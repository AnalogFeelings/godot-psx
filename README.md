A small pack of shaders to replicate that old PS1 look in Godot 4.0.  
They may also work on Godot 3.x, but they haven't been tested. Proceed with caution!

:warning: **Warning!** It seems per-vertex lighting is currently broken in Godot 4.0, so you may need to try to use 3.x to get vertex lighting.
